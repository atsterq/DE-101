# SQL
SQL is the most dominant language for data operations in data engineering. So I decided to took [SQL course from learndb.com](https://learndb.ru/courses)

# Database installation
- Installed [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) database;
- Installed [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download/) - database management tool.

# Connection to Database and SQL queries
- Created new database in PostgreSQL;
- Used [orders](https://github.com/atsterq/DE-101/blob/main/Module2/2.3/create_orders_table.sql), [people](https://github.com/atsterq/DE-101/blob/main/Module2/2.3/create_people_table.sql) and [returns](https://github.com/atsterq/DE-101/blob/main/Module2/2.3/create_returns_table.sql) SQL scripts to create relevant tables;
- To overview given dataset wrote [SQL queries](https://github.com/atsterq/DE-101/blob/main/Module2/2.3/overview.sql), showing the following metrics:
  - Total Sales;
  - Total Profit;
  - Profit Ratio;
  - Profit per Order;
  - Sales per Customer;
  - Avg. Discount;
  - Monthly Sales by Segment;
  - Monthly Sales by Product Category;
  - Sales by Product Category over time;
  - Sales and Profit by Customer;
  - Customer Ranking;
  - Sales per region.
