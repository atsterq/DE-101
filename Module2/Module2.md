# SQL
SQL is the most dominant language for data operations in data engineering. Data engineers use SQL to make data accessible for querying, collect raw data, clean it, model it, and let end-users access the clean data. So I decided to took [SQL course from learndb.ru](https://learndb.ru/courses).

# Database installation
- Installed [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) database;
- Installed [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download/) - database management tool.

# Connection to Database and SQL queries practice
- Created new database in PostgreSQL;
- Used [orders](https://github.com/atsterq/DE-101/blob/main/Module2/2.3/create_orders_table.sql), [people](https://github.com/atsterq/DE-101/blob/main/Module2/2.3/create_people_table.sql) and [returns](https://github.com/atsterq/DE-101/blob/main/Module2/2.3/create_returns_table.sql) SQL scripts to create relevant tables;
- To overview given dataset wrote [SQL queries](https://github.com/atsterq/DE-101/blob/main/Module2/2.3/overview.sql), showing the following metrics:
  - Total Sales;
  - Total Profit;
  - Profit Ratio;
  - Profit per Order;
  - Sales per Customer;
  - Avg. Discount;
  - Monthly Sales by Segment;
  - Monthly Sales by Product Category;
  - Sales by Product Category over time;
  - Sales and Profit by Customer;
  - Customer Ranking;
  - Sales per region.
