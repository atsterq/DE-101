# Data engineering 101
What is data engineering and why is it important?  

An organization exists to deliver **value**. There are 3 key groups who can benefit from a business:
- Business owners (shareholders);
- Employees;
- Customers.

In order for a business to grow, you need to create more value for each group.  
For customers, for example, customer experience. For employees - work-life balance, salary. For owners, income.  
All of these groups make decisions (decision making) to successfully grow the business and do their jobs. In order to make decisions, you need **data**. Data can be raw data or it can be organized raw data. One of the tasks of the data engineer is to **provide data** to the groups described above for further **decision making**. Therefore, it is important to understand exactly how the work done by the data engineer affects what happens to the business.  

Here I will be consistently posting the practical work of learning data engineering instruments and concepts following [DE-101](https://github.com/Data-Learn/data-engineering/blob/master/DE%20-%20101%20Guide.md) course:
- [Excel dashboards and introduction to data flow architecture](https://github.com/atsterq/DE-101/blob/main/Module1/Module1.md).
